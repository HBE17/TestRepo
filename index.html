          <p>Today's tribute is to a modern day legend who has surpassed established legends such as Michel Platini. His skills, grace, and pure class captivated audiences for years.
        </p>
         <p>   
        I speak, of course, of the legend—Zinedine Zidane.
        </p>
         <p>   
        Zinedine Yazid Zidane, born 23 June, 1972 spent his early years in Marseille as the son of Algerian immigrants. At ten years old, he joined his first youth club, US Saint Henri. A few years later and he was spotted by a scout from French club AS Cannes.
        </p>
            <p>
        Zidane liked the idea of playing for a professional club, so went for a six week trial period. Cannes liked what they saw, and the six weeks soon became four years.
        </p>
            <p>
        Soon after signing his first professional contract, Zidane made his Cannes debut, aged just 17. He was by no means a first team regular, but his skill was evident even from that early age.
        </p>
            <p>
        Despite making his debut in 1988, it wasn't until 1991 that Zidane scored his first ever professional goal. The team president was so delighted with his young starlet that he bought him a car.
        </p>
            <p>
        From this moment on, he started playing much more regularly. In his first two seasons at Cannes, he only played two games. During the next two seasons, however, he was involved in 63 games, scoring six times.
        </p>
            <p>
        It was while at Bordeaux that Zidane was approached by both Algeria and France, both of whom he was eligible to play for. It was rumoured that the Algerian coach actually turned Zidane down because he was too slow.
        </p>
            <p>
        Whatever the true story, Zidane opted for France, and made his debut in 1994, coming on as a sub against Czech Republic, and scoring two goals in 16 minutes.
        </p>
            <p>
        Zidane had arrived on the world scene.
        </p>
            <p>
        Zidane's performances made him a contender for his second World Player of the Year crown. It was a crown he accepted, becoming only the second player to have been named World Footballer of the Year twice, the first being Ronaldo.
        </p>
            <p>
        In 2001, Zidane became a target for Real Madrid. The assembly of the "Galacticos" was in full swing, and Zidane would be the main attraction. It would take a lot of money to get him, however. And it did.
        </p>
        Real Madrid forked out a reported £47.5 million for Zidane, a transfer fee which, to this day, remains a record.
            <p>
        He was one of the few players in history who was actually worth that much.
        </p>
            <p>
        The next season, in a Champions League final, Zidane hit one of the best goals the competition has ever seen, a spectacular volley which turned out to be the winning goal. He went on to win the Intercontinental Cup and the European Super Cup that same year.
        </p> 
            <p>
        However, the World Cup didn't go as well for him. Injury ruled him out of France's first two games, which included a humiliating loss to minnows Senegal, and despite returning for the third game, he couldn't do anything about France crashing unceremoniously out in the group-stages, without scoring a goal.
        </p> 
            <p>
        In 2003, however, Zidane tasted more success, again with Real Madrid. This time, it was La Liga and the Spanish Super Cup. Individually, Zidane was awarded the World Player of the Year accolade yet again, becoming the second person to have won it three times, again, Ronaldo beat him to it.
        </p> 
            <p>
        Due to Zidane's game not relying on pace, his age didn't seem to have much affect on his play. In fact, at times it seemed to help, rather than hinder, him.
        </p> 
            <p>
        A barren spell at Real Madrid saw the break-up of some of the "Galacticos", and an injury ravaged Zidane announced he was planning to retire from all football after the 2006 World Cup.
        </p> 
            <p>
        It was at this World Cup where one of his more infamous moments came.
        </p>
            
            <p>
        Despite a slow start, and Zidane getting himself suspended, France made it through from the group stages. In the second round Zidane returned, creating and scoring a goal. It was more of the same throughout the tournament.
        </p> 
            <p>
        France found themselves in another World Cup final, this time against Italy.
        </p> 
            <p>
        Zidane, in his last ever competitive game of football, scored an early penalty, becoming only the fourth man to have scored in two different World Cup finals. Italy equalised and it went into extra-time.
        </p> 
            
           <p>
        In the 110th minute, while walking back after an attack, Marco Materazzi uttered something to Zidane. Zidane turned round a headbutted him in the chest, and was sent off.
        </p> 
            <p>
        It was a shame that one of the greatest players ever saw a red card as his last sight on a football field, but what a way to go out!
        </p>
            <p>
        Overall in his illustrious career, Zidane played in 732 games, scoring 144 goals, and creating hundreds more. For France he played 108 times, scoring 31 times.
        </p> 
            <p>
        He will always be remembered as a genius on the football field, and perhaps one of the most graceful players ever. A three-time World Player of the Year, this has been a tribute to Zinedine Zidane.
